## Code Breakdown

### Bot Initialization
- The bot is initialized using the `ApplicationBuilder` from the `python-telegram-bot` library.
- The `/start` command provides a welcome message.

### Cohere Integration
- The `cohere_chat` function sends user queries to the Cohere API and retrieves a response using the specified model.
- Adjust parameters like `max_tokens`, `temperature`, `k`, and `p` for fine-tuning responses.

### Handlers
- `/start`: Sends a welcome message to the user.
- Message Handler: Captures user queries, processes them using the `cohere_chat` function, and sends responses back.
